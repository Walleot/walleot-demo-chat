This is a demo chat application built with Next.js, showcasing Walleot payments. It generates images in exchange for demo credits.
To use it, simply request an image â€” the system will prompt for a payment (in demo credits) before generating the image.

Create .env.local file with:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY = xxxxx
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
